      <itunes:summary>The New York Times and Siena College conducted a major new poll, tackling the biggest questions about the 2020 presidential race: How likely is President Trump to be re-elected and which Democrat is best positioned to defeat him? 

The results reveal that the president remains highly competitive in the battleground states likeliest to decide his re-election, with Democratic candidates struggling to win back the support of white working-class voters who backed Mr. Trump in 2016. 

The poll also presents a snapshot of how the top Democratic candidates might fare in the general election — a critical question for Democratic voters hoping to take back the White House.

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>The House of Representatives voted to begin the next phase of the impeachment inquiry into President Trump — one which will be open to public scrutiny. Two Democrats in the House broke ranks and voted against the resolution, which outlined rules for the impeachment process.

      <title>The ‘Most Damning’ Impeachment Testimony Yet</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>The Democrats leading the impeachment inquiry are calling testimony from the acting envoy to Ukraine the “most damning” yet, implicating President Trump himself in a quid pro quo over military aid to the country. William B. Taylor Jr., a career diplomat who has served under both Democratic and Republican administrations, prepared a 15-page opening statement for investigators on Tuesday. He described his testimony as “a rancorous story about whistle-blowers, Mr. Giuliani, side channels, quid pro quos, corruption and interference in elections.” In his statement, Mr. Taylor documented two divergent channels of United States policymaking in Ukraine, “one regular and one highly irregular.” He said Mr. Trump had used the shadow channel to make America’s relationship with Ukraine — including a $391 million aid package — conditional on its government’s willingness to investigate one of his political rivals, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., and his family. The question of a quid pro quo for the military aid has been pursued by House Democrats since the beginning of the impeachment inquiry.

        <![CDATA[<p>The Democrats leading the impeachment inquiry are calling testimony from the acting envoy to Ukraine the “most damning” yet, implicating President Trump himself in a quid pro quo over military aid to the country. William B. Taylor Jr., a career diplomat who has served under both Democratic and Republican administrations, prepared a 15-page opening statement for investigators on Tuesday. He described his testimony as “a rancorous story about whistle-blowers, Mr. Giuliani, side channels, quid pro quos, corruption and interference in elections.” In his statement, Mr. Taylor documented two divergent channels of United States policymaking in Ukraine, “one regular and one highly irregular.” He said Mr. Trump had used the shadow channel to make America’s relationship with Ukraine — including a $391 million aid package — conditional on its government’s willingness to investigate one of his political rivals, former Vice President Joseph R.

      <itunes:summary>This week, we’re producing episodes of “The Daily” from The New York Times’s Washington bureau. 

The impeachment inquiry is entering a pivotal phase as Congress returns from recess. The White House’s strategy to block the investigation is beginning to crumble, with five administration officials set to testify before House investigators.

On Monday, those committees heard testimony about why the president removed the longtime ambassador, Marie L. Yovanovitch, just two months before the call in which he asked the Ukrainian president for a favor. Today, we look at how Ms. Yovanovitch ended up at the center of the impeachment process. 

Guests: Sharon LaFraniere, an investigative reporter based in Washington, and Rachel Quester and Clare Toeniskoetter, producers for “The Daily.” For more information on today’s episode, visit nytimes.com/thedaily. 

Background coverage: Marie L. Yovanovitch told House investigators that she was removed from office on the basis of “false claims by people with clearly questionable motives.” The effort to pressure Ukraine so alarmed John Bolton, then the national security adviser, that he told an aide to alert White House lawyers. “Giuliani’s a hand grenade who’s going to blow everybody up,” an aide quoted him as saying of President Trump’s personal lawyer.</itunes:summary>

Guests: The Provosts, who spoke with Adizah Eghan and Annie Brown, producers for “1619.”

Today, we meet a moderate Democrat who offers a competing vision of the party ahead of the 2020 election. 

Guests: Representative Mikie Sherrill, Democrat of New Jersey; Kate Zernike, a political reporter for The New York Times; and Lisa Chow and Rachel Quester, producers for “The Daily.” For more information on today’s episode, visit nytimes.com/thedaily. 

Background reading: Disconnects between liberal and moderate House Democrats have exploded into public view at critical moments during their seven months in power.The two rounds of Democratic presidential debates showcased divisions over ideology and identity in a party that appears united only in its desire to defeat President Trump.</itunes:summary>

      <title>The Democrats and Israel</title>
      <description>

      <title>‘The Most Significant Campaign Contributions’ in U.S. History</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>It was never clear what motivated Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, to hand the investigation of Michael D. Cohen, President Trump’s former lawyer, over to career prosecutors in New York rather than to the special counsel. With that investigation now implicating the president in serious campaign finance violations, we look at how fateful the decision may be. Guests: Neal Katyal, a lawyer who drafted the rules that govern special counsel investigations, and Michael S. Schmidt, who has been covering the special counsel investigation for The New York Times.

      <itunes:summary>It was never clear what motivated Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, to hand the investigation of Michael D. Cohen, President Trump’s former lawyer, over to career prosecutors in New York rather than to the special counsel. With that investigation now implicating the president in serious campaign finance violations, we look at how fateful the decision may be. Guests: Neal Katyal, a lawyer who drafted the rules that govern special counsel investigations, and Michael S. Schmidt, who has been covering the special counsel investigation for The New York Times.

Its continued success is challenging not just the West’s assumptions about China, but the West’s assumptions about itself. Guest: Philip P. Pan, the Asia editor for The New York Times.

      <title>Why U.S. Bombs Are Falling in Yemen</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>The killing of Jamal Khashoggi has renewed criticism of Saudi Arabia more broadly, including the kingdom’s role in the war in Yemen.

      <title>Susan Collins on Roe v. Wade and the Next Justice</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>When Justice Anthony M. Kennedy announced last week that he would retire this summer, attention immediately turned to the few senators who are willing to break from their parties on major issues — and who may hold the fate of the next Supreme Court nominee in their hands. We speak to one of them. Guest: Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine. For more information on today’s episode, visit nytimes.com/thedaily.</p><p><em>Correction: An earlier version of this episode included a comment from Senator Susan Collins that misstated Americans’ views on the Supreme Court’s ruling in Roe v. Wade. While Americans are deeply divided on abortion rights, about 69 percent of adults oppose overturning the Supreme Court precedent; it is not “something like a 51-49” issue, as Ms. Collins said.</em></p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Ida B. Wells was an investigative reporter who exposed the systematic lynching of black men in the South. Her work made her the most famous black woman in the country. But when she died in 1931, at the age of 68, The New York Times failed to write an obituary. Obituaries in The Times have been long dominated by white men. Now, the paper of record is trying to fix the record. Guests: Amisha Padnani, the digital editor on The Times’s obituaries desk and a leader of the Overlooked project; Caitlin Dickerson, a national reporter for The Times; Michelle Duster, a professor at Columbia College Chicago and a great-granddaughter of Ida B. Wells. For more information on today’s episode, visit <a href="http://nytimes.com/thedaily" target="_blank">nytimes.com/thedaily</a>.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Rex Tillerson’s relationship with President Trump was rocky from the start. But no one was more surprised than Mr. Tillerson when he was fired as secretary of state on Tuesday. Mr. Tillerson was the most persistent advocate of opening diplomatic channels with North Korea, a position that put him publicly at odds with his boss. As Mr. Trump prepares to meet Kim Jong-un, the North’s leader, we talk to the man who came closest to a deal with Pyongyang about what the current administration can learn from previous attempts. Guests: Mark Landler, a White House correspondent for The New York Times; William Perry, a former secretary of defense and one of the few senior U.S. officials to have negotiated directly with the North Koreans.

Bannon, the president’s former chief strategist, backed away from calling Donald Trump Jr. “treasonous.” Why did a publication with little new reporting in it cause such a big stir? Guests: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/peter-baker" target="_blank">Peter Baker</a>, chief White House correspondent for The New York Times; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/jeremy-w-peters" target="_blank">Jeremy W. Peters</a>, a Times journalist who has reported on Mr. Bannon for years.

        <![CDATA[<p>The opioid crisis in the United States now rivals the Vietnam War in terms of how many Americans have been killed. After calling the opioid crisis a national emergency, President Trump has officially declared it a public health emergency — a distinction with a difference. We speak with a recovering addict who was 14 when he tried oxycodone for the first time. &nbsp;“By everyone’s standards, I should be dead,” he said about his former drug dependency. Guests: Aaron Pope, who lives outside Lexington, Ky.; <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/julie-hirschfeld-davis" target="_blank">Julie Hirschfeld Davis</a>, a White House correspondent for The Times.

        <![CDATA[<p>A New York Times investigation has found three decades of sexual harassment allegations against the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein.
